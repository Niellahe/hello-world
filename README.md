### About Me
This is my first ever repository. I am currently in the process of teaching myself how to code, with the end goal to become a fulltime web developper.
I have a plan of sorts is my mind with the steps I'm aiming to take:

1. Learn HTML and CSS
2. Learn Javascript
3. Learn Python

I am relying on a couple of resources to teach myself how to code. Most prominent of sources are:
- Head First HTML & CSS
- Head First Javascript Programming
- [Udemy Web Development Course 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/learn/lecture/17032320?start=15#overview)
